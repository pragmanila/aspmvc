# ASP Core Skills Test

## Instructions:
1. Create a simple application that utilizes APIs below on a fully responsive and cross browser compatible web page using an ASP.NET Core

API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

2. fork this repo, do your code, commit and push then send a link to your work. (github account is required.)

## Functional Requirements:
1. App should be able to list users from the API by name username and email with associated VIEW, EDIT and DELETE functions each row.
2. App should be able to search for any user by name or username with a minimum of 3 characters. 
3. Users on the list needs to be stored on memory (if a refresh resets the data its fine.)
4. clicking on view should display all data related to the user
5. clicking on edit should change the data updated with the proper data type.
6. clicking on delete should remove the user from the list

## Rules/Pointers:
- there is no time limit. you can polish the application as you see fit before submitting.
- Any framework / libraries can be used to accomplish the task
- completed exam should be pushed through github on a public repo (you can delete after evaluation)

## Key Factors fo consider:
- clearly written code is a big plus
- use best practices to write code
- present the app in the best design possible
- we'll be looking at how you commit code
